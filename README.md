# Plant Shop: A Modern E-Commerce & Content Platform

**A Django application that blends a curated e-commerce experience with rich content and community features to help plant lovers thrive.**

This project isn't just another online store. It's a platform designed from the ground up to provide a seamless and enjoyable journey for both new and experienced plant owners. It tackles the common frustrations of online plant shopping: cluttered interfaces and a lack of post-purchase support.

> **Note:** The templates (HTML) were created with the help of AI.

## üì¶ Quick Start

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/init050/plant-shop.git
    cd plant-shop
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Set up environment variables
    # The project already contains a .env file, but a .env.example is recommended for new contributors.
    # Ensure your .env file has the necessary database credentials and a SECRET_KEY.
    # cp .env.example .env 

    # Apply database migrations
    python manage.py migrate

    # Run the development server
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3.  **Set up the frontend:**
    *In a new terminal*, navigate to the project root and run the Tailwind CSS build process. This will watch for changes and automatically rebuild your CSS.

    # (From the project root directory)
    npm install
    npm run build-css
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**

## üìù Lessons Learned & Design Decisions

This project involved several key design trade-offs, such as choosing a monolithic architecture for simplicity and speed over a microservices approach. For a full discussion of what we learned and the reasoning behind our technical choices, see [**Lessons Learned**](./docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md).
